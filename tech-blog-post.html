Technically, Rails is a web application development framework, aka a software library. What does that mean though? I like to think of it as the special power that Ruby gets to have, that makes her smarter when she reads your code. Rails is a back end webb application development platform. 

Ruby on Rails is not like Javascript. There are a lot of things to know about the way in which Ruby runs on Rails. It may take a lot of practice. But once you learn all of the tricks and tidbits you will be well on your way making beautiful and meaningful things. 

Rails extends the Ruby programming language. This means that it is a Ruby Gem that is installed using the command line. Application programming interface, or API is the stuff you learn about to make Rails work with the Ruby language. 

You can use Ruby on Rails with HTML, CSS and JS to create beautiful applications that run on a web server. Rails is becoming super popular and its followers are very close and share their techniques and skills with each other.
