#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that padding is great for separating elements and making space in between the elements. Borders are great because they help visualize and organize an element into a confined space/box. Margins are helpful because thats how you move an element around the page, so its very important to know how to play with margin sizing on all 4 sides of an element to be able to space it out.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Positioning is super difficult for me, but I found that playing with the sizes of margins is helpful for moving elements around in a confined box. Also, padding helps position and separate elements. 

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Like I said above, I found positioning elements difficult because of the position property is a little vague and sometimes I found myself doing the same thing over and over again. I found playing with borders and colors the easiest and most fun aspect of design. 

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that formating and adding elements in CSS is really hard!! But I do like it. I did fall down the rabbit hole and spent extra time which I admit, but I had nothing to do this weekend so I edited a lot. I enjoeyed it. CSS is great though. I'm excited to learn more!
