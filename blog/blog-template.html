-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Wireframing was very interesting. I really enjoyed learning about user experience and now that I understand how to wireframe in a basic mockup of a web page I am really thinking about all that I've learned.

-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I found that wireframing is the bridge that will lead me to understanding CSS and more design elements. Web design really interests me. In my development of my blog for my site, wireframing is the key to success. 

-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
My pair and I decided that a good wireframe for a blog was to be a skeleton like, basic, clear, and minimalist frame. This is because this design is for a blog, which contains a lot of text, and it is where people communicate by posting on blogs. That said, the frame that holds the text needs to be sturdy and not distracting. 

-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
My pair and I began to understand how to place a link within a link to create a button like element, a link with a name, not an image. This was hard for us, but we got the hang of it.
