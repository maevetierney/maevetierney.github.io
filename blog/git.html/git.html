-What are the benefits of version control?
As a developer, there are many benefits of using version control while you are writing code on your computer. Version control keeps track of all of your files. Instead of the computer saving every keystroke like when you’re typing in a word document, you have to save a bundle of changes called a commit. You can go back if you did something wrong and work with a different commit to work into a different version of your code. What’s even better is that version control is awesome for working with a lot of collaborators on the same code. Instead of sending code back and forth and getting caught up in tiny details, you can merge commits using version control to create one final document. Using Version Control ensures that no one person could overwrite the file and also that no one person can delete another person’s entire file. There are different version control systems out there, and Git is the one we are using.

      -How does git help you keep track of changes?
Git helps you track changes in a lot of ways. To begin, Git saves your base code in a master branch. Then, you can create multiple separate branches to save different versions of your code as your work on it. This is great because it allows you to track the different stages of development for your code. Git stores all of the commits and makes sure that you don’t accidentally delete important parts of your code. Git also allows you to merge different branches together, and also allows you to publish them onto GitHub.com which is a social programming platform where many people can look at other people’s code and also edit and contribute together.

-Why use GitHub to store your code?
You should use GitHub to store your code because its an awesome social platform that is easy to use! But also, GitHub is great because instead of storing code locally on your computer, you can store it remotely on GitHub.com. All the Git that you use on your computer isn’t automatically pushed to GitHub.com. You have to type specific commands to tell the file what to do and where to go/merge – this is called push.
